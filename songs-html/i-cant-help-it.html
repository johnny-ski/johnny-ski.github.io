  <pre>Intro:
B B E E

Verse:
E/B E A E
B B E E
E/B E A E
B B E E

Chorus:
A A E E 
B B E E
A A E E
B B E E

Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

  A picture from the past came slowly stealing
  As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
  Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
  I can't help it if I'm still in love with you.

Split break over verse (steel then fiddle)

  It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
  And hold you just the way I used to do
  Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
  I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
