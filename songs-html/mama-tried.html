The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a youngin's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind but mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
Til mama couldn't hold me anymore

  And I turned twenty-one in prison
  Doing life without parole
  No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
  Mama tried to raise me better
  But her pleading I denied
  That leaves only me to blame, cause mama tried

Dear old daddy rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused
