Well, I pulled outta Pittsburgh
A-rollin' down that eastern seaboard
I got my diesel wound up, and she's a-runnin' like a-never before
There's a speed zone ahead, well, alright
I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

I got me ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills, and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy and a White
I been a-passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well, it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women, but I'm a-not a-like a-some of the guys
I could find one to hold me tight
But I could never make believe it's all right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

ICC is checkin' on down the line
Well, I'm a little overweight, and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight
I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight

Well, my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
That's a flame from my stack and that smoke's a-blowin' black as coal
My hometown's a-comin' in sight
If you think I'm a-happy, you're right
Six days on the road and I'm a-gonna make it home tonight
