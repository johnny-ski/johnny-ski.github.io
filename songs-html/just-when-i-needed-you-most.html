  <h1>Just When I Needed You Most â€“ Randy VanWarmer</h1>
  <pre>Verse:       Chorus:
D D D G      G D A D
G D Em A     G D A D
D D D G

You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window, and I
struggled for something to say
Left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now, I miss you more than I
Missed you before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows

  'Cause you left me
  Just when I needed you most

Now most every morning, I
Stare out the window, and I
Think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more than I
Needed before and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows

You packed in the morning, I
Stared out the window, and I
struggled for something to say
Left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I love you more than I
Loved you before, and now
Where I'll find comfort, God knows

Performance notes: add an extra bar of the one before coming back into the verse if needed
