I've been walkin' in my sleep
Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
Where the years went I can't say
I just turned around and they've gone away

I've been siftin' through the layers
Of dusty books and faded papers
They tell a story I used to know
And it was one that happened so long ago

  It's gone away yesterday
  Now I find myself on the mountainside
  Where the rivers change direction
  Across the great divide

Well I heard the owl callin'
Softly as the night was fallin'
To a question, I replied
That he's gone across the borderline

The finest hour I have seen
Is the one that comes between
The edge of night and the break of day
Where the darkness falls away</pre>
