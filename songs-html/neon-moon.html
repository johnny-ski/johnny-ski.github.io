Chorus:
D E D E
D E A A

When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
The whole world turns...blue

There's a rundown bar cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two yay in the back
Where I sit alone...and think of losing you

I spend most every night, beneath the light
Of this neon moon

  If you lose your one and only
  There's always room here for the lonely
  To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
  Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows...of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Telling my poor heart...she'll come back someday

Oh, but I'll be alright, as long as there's light
From a neon moon

The jukebox plays on drink by drink
The words of every sad song seem to say what I think
This hurt inside of me...ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright, as long as there's light
From a neon moon
