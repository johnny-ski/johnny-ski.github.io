We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
We like livin' right, and bein' free

We don't make a party out of lovin'
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo
We don't let our hair grow long and nasty and dirty
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

  I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
  A place where even squares can have a ball
  We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
  And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
And football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids they still respect the college dean
