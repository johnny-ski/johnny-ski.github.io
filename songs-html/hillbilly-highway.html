My granddaddy was a miner
But he finally saw the light
He didn't have much, just a beat-up truck
And a dream about a better life
Grandmama cried when she waved goodbye
You never heard such a lonesome sound
Pretty soon the dirt road turned into blacktop
Detroit City bound

  Down that hillbilly highway
  On that hillbilly highway
  That old hillbilly highway
  Goes on and on

Now he worked and he saved his money
So that one day he might send
My old man off to college
To use his brains and not his hands
Grandmama cried when he said goodbye
You never heard such a lonesome sound
Daddy had himself a good job in Houston
One more rolling down

Now Granddaddy rolled over in his grave
The day that I quit school
I just sat around the house playing my guitar
And Daddy said I was a fool
My mama cried when I said goodbye
You never heard such a lonesome sound
Now I'm standing on this highway
And if you're going my way
You know where I'm bound
