  <pre>Verse:     Chorus:
G G G G    D D G G
G G D D    G G D D
G G G G    G G G G
G D G G    G D G G

There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

  Well love me if you're ever gonna love me
  I never have seen a road too rough to ride
  There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
  There ain't no man big enough to stop me
  I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Stop right before split break (fiddle then steel) over verse chords

There ain't no ropes tight enough to bind me
Look for me honey and you'll find me
Any old time you're ready with your charms
I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

  Well love me if you're ever gonna love me
  I never have seen a road too rough to ride
  Hey I'll be there ready and a waitin'
  There won't be any hesitatin'
  I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Key selection:
Johnny Bush â€“ D
Don Williams â€“ A
