Honky Tonk Song â€“ Webb Pierce

I got me a room in a cheap hotel
My head was a spinning and I didn't feel well
I laid right down and I tried to go to sleep
But the band kept a playing in the joint underneath
I picked up my pillow and I covered up my head
But the band kept a playing and a shaking my bed

  Honky tonk, all night long
  Honky tonk, same old song
  Honky tonk, the money's all gone
  Honky tonk, she done me wrong
  I turned and I tossed but I couldn't go to sleep
  Cause the band kept a playing with a honky tonk beat

Well I'm so blue, my baby's gone
She took all my money, and she left me all alone
I'm trying to forget her, but I don't what to do
Cause the honky tong song keeps a leaking through
I picked up my pillow and I covered up my head
But the band kept a playing and a shaking my bed
