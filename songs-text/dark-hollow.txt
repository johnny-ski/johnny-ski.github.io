I'd rather be in some dark hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to be at home alone and knowing that you're gone
Would cause me to lose my mind

  So blow your whistle freight train
  Take me far on down the track
  I'm going away, I'm leaving today
  I'm going, but I ain't coming back

I'd rather be ...
Than to be in some big city
In a small room, with a girl on my mind

I'd rather be ...
Than to see you another man's darling
And to know you won't ever be mine
