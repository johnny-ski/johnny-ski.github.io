The Last Thing On My Mind – Tom Paxton

Verse:
1 4 1 1/4
1 5 1 1

Chorus:
5 5 4 1 1
4 1 5 5
4 4 1 1
5 5 1 1

There's a lesson too late for the learnin'
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand

  Are you going away with no words of farewell
  May there be not a trace left behind?
  I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
  You know that was the last thing on my mind

When I woke up early this mornin'
You smiled at me, you smiled at me
The song in my heart was surely bornin
You set me free, you set me free

You've got reasons a-plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

As I lie in my bed in the mornin'
Without you, without you
Every song in my breast lies a bornin'
Without you, without you
