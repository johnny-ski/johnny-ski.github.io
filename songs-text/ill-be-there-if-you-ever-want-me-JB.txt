I'll Be There If You Ever Want Me - Johnny Bush

Verse:     Chorus:
G G G G    D D G G
G G D D    G G D D
G G G G    G G G G
G D G G    G D G G

There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Well love me if you're ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Stop right before break

There ain't no ropes tight enough to bind me
Look for me honey and you'll find me
Any old time you're ready with your charms
I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Well love me if you're ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
Hey I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
