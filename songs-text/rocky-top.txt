Chorus:

G/F G

Wish that I was on ol' Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear, other half cat
Wild as a mink, but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

  Rocky Top, you'll always be
  Home sweet home to me
  Good ol' Rocky Top
  Rocky Top, Tennessee
  Rocky Top, Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

  Chorus

I've had years of crimped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again

  Chorus

Performance notes:
Original key is B, with guitar and banjo in 4th gear
