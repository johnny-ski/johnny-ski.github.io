I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows the water rolls high
I hear a voice call out there in the darkness
I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

  Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
  I sit on the shore to weep and to cry
  The woman I love she left me this morning
  With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

We met there one night on the banks of the river
Stood holding hands and making our vows
Swore we’d never part, we'd be happy together
But a new love she’s found, she’s gone from me now
