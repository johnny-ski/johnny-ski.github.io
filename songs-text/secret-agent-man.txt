Secret Agent Man â€“ Johnny Rivers

Intro:
Em (6 bars)

Verse:          Chorus:
Em Am Em Em     Bm Em Bm Em
Em Em B7 B7     C7 B7 B7 Em
Em Em Am Am     Em Em Em
Em Am Em Em

There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes
Another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

  Secret Agent Man
  Secret Agent Man
  They've given you a number and taken away your name

Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Oh, be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

Swinging on the Riviera one day
And then laying in a Bombay island next day
Oh, don't you let the wrong words slip
While kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow

Note: last time through the chorus add 2 extra bars of Em and then big rock and roll ending
