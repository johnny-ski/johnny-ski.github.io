From this valley they say you are going
I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened our path for a while

  Come and sit by my side if you love me
  Do not hasten to bid me adieu
  But remember the Red River Valley
  And the cowboy who loved you so true

Can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
It's so cold lying here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
And I assure you I'll do you no wrong

Performance notes: For a western feel, use a 5-of-the-5 move in the 8th bar and a 1-4 move in the last bar.
