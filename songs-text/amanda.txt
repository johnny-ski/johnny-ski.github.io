Amanda – Waylon Jennings

I've held it all inward, God knows I've tried
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.

  Amanda, light of my life
  Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife
  Amanda, light of my life
  Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I've finally made forty and still wearin' jeans
