We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin’ ’bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I’m going to Jackson, I’m gonna mess around
Yeah, I’m goin’ to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Well, go on down to Jackson; go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand you big-talkin’ man, make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson; go comb your hair!
Honey, I’m gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna make me, teach ’em what they don’t know how
I’m goin’ to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
‘Cos I’m goin’ to Jackson
“Goodbye,” that’s all she wrote

But they’ll laugh at you in Jackson, and I’ll be dancin’ on a Pony Keg
They’ll lead you ’round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin’ man
And I’ll be waitin’ in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan

Well now, We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper Sprout
We’ve been talkin’ ’bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I’m goin’ to Jackson, and that’s a fact
Yeah, we’re goin’ to Jackson, ain’t never comin’ back

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mhmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout’
And we’ve been talkin’ ’bout Jackson, ever since the fire went...
