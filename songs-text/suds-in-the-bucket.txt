She was in the backyard, say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up, a white pickup truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin', it was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough, and you can't stop love

She stuck a note on the screen door, "sorry but I got to go"
That was all she wrote, her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote, so the story goes

  Now her daddy's in the kitchen, starin' out the window
  Scratchin' and a rackin' his brains
  How could 18 years just up and walk away
  Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
  Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
  She left the suds in the bucket
  And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Break (4 bars)

Now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker, a smooth talkin' son of a gun
For such a grounded girl, to just up and run
Course you can't fence time, and you can't stop love

  Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop gossip goin' non-stop
  Sippin' on pink lemonade
  How could 18 years just up and walk away
  Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
  Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
  She left the suds in the bucket
  And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Guitar break (20 bars)

  She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
  And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
  How could 18 years just up and walk away
  Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
  Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
  She left the suds in the bucket
  And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Tag (last 4 bars of chorus)

She was in the backyard, say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up, a white picked truck
Plenty old enough, and you can't stop love
And no you can't fence time, and you can't stop love
