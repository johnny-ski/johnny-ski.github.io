Every time it rains Lord I run to my window
All I do is wring my hands and moan
Listen to that thunder roll and I can hear that lonesome wind blow
Tell me baby why you been gone so long

  Tell me baby why you been gone so long you been gone so long now
  Tell me baby why you been gone so long
  Wolf is scratching at my door and I can hear that lonesome wind moan
  Tell me baby why you been gone so long

Someone said they thought they saw you roaring down in Reno
With a big ol' man from San Antone
They tell me I'm a fool to pine for you but what do they know
Tell me baby why you been gone so long

There ain't nothing I wanna do, oh I guess I could get stoned
And let the past paint pictures on my head
Kill a fifth of Thunderbird and try to write a sad song
Tell me baby why you been gone so long
