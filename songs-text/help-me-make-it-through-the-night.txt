Help Me Make It Through The Night – Sammi Smith

Verse:      Chorus:
D D G Em    G G D D
A A D D     E E A A

Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon your skin
Like the shadows on the wall

Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
  I don't care who's right or wrong
  I don't try to understand
  Let the devil take tomorrow
  Lord, tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night
