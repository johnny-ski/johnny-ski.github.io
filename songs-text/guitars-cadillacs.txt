Guitars, Cadillacs – Dwight Yoakam

Girl, you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
Showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
Found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

  Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
  Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
  Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
  Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on

There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh, but thank you girl, for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
