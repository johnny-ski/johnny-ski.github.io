Verse 1:
Let me tell ya 'bout a place, somewhere up New York way
Where the people are so gay, twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, putting trouble on the run
Man you find the old and young, twisting the night a-way

Chorus:
Twisting, twisting, everybody's doing great
Twisting, twisting, they're twisting the night a-way

Verse 2:
Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know.
Man you gotta see him go, twisting the night away.
He's dancing with a chick in slacks, She’s moving up and back.
Oh man, there ain’t nothing like, twisting the night a-way

Chorus

Break (same chords as verse):
Lean up, lean back,
Lean up, lean back.
Wa-tusi, now fly,
Now twist...  they're twisting the night a-way

Verse 3:
Here's a fella in blue jeans, dancing with an older queen
Who’s dolled up in diamond ring, twisting the night away
Man you gotta see her go, twisting to the rock'n'roll
Here you find the old and young, twisting the night a-way

Chorus

Break (repeat to end)
