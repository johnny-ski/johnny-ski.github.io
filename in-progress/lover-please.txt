Lover please, please come back
Don't take the train coming down the track
Don't please, don't please, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery

You will never hold me so near
You will never call me "Dear"
Dontcha know I'd die for you?
Now you're gone, that's what I'll do

Lover please...

Guitar break 

Old love story, not too long
About a love that went all wrong
Girl loved boy, boy went bad
Now he's gone, and she's so sad

Lover please...

Lover please...

Guitar break

Lover please...

Lover please...
