Guitar intro (4 bars G)

  Down every road there's always one more city
  I'm on the run, the highway is my home

I raised a lot of cane back in my younger days
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail
Now I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

  I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
  A fugitive must be a rolling stone
  Down every road there's always one more city
  I'm on the run, the highway is my home

  8 bar guitar break (last half of chorus)

I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury
Of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone
