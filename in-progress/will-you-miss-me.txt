Will You Miss Me – Stanley Brothers

When these lips shall never more
Place a kiss upon thy brow
But lie cold and still in death
Will you love me then as now?

  Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)
  Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone)
  Will you miss me (miss me when I'm gone on)
  Will you miss me when I'm gone

Perhaps you'll plant some flowers
On my poor unworthy grave
Come and sit along beside me
When the roses nod and wave
