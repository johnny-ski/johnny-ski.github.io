I'll Be There If You Ever Want Me - Ray Price

There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
Never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
Ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Love me if you're ever gonna love me
Never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side

Break

There ain't no ropes tight enough to bind me
Look for me honey you will find me
Any old time you're ready with your charms
I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be here if you ever want me in your arms

Love me if you're ever gonna love me
Never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no chain strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
