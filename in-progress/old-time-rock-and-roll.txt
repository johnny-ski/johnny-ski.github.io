Old Time Rock And Roll – Bob Seger

Verse
1 1 4 4
5 5 1 1

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock and roll

Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock and roll

  Still like that old time rock and roll
  That kind of music just soothes the soul
  I reminisce about the days of old
  With that old time rock and roll

Won't go to hear 'em play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playin' old time rock and roll
