I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows the water rolls high
I hear a voice calling out there in the darkness
I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

  Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
  I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
  The woman I love she left me this morning
  With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

We met there one night by the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vows
Swore we’d never part and be happy together
But a new love she’s found she’s gone from me now
